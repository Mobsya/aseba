<h1>Scratch 3</h1>

<h2>What is Scratch?</h2>
<p>Scratch is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab. It allows you to program Thymio to interact with its environnement and with the Scratch screen. For example, show the values of Thymio's sensors on the screen, tell a story or create a video game that uses Thymio as a remote control.</p><br>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Select different Scratch and/or Thymio blocks and assemble them together. The blocks that are related to Thymio are in the extension category (the bottom-left button on Scratch interface).</p><br>
