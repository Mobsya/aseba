# Install the Thymio Suite on Linux

## Install Flatpak

Please refer to the installation instructions on [Flathub](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

## Set-up `udev` rules for thymio

Before being able to use a Thymio, you need to set up the
appropriate udev rules to grant your user account permissions
to use the device? This only needs to be done once per computer and doesn't have to be
done again if you reinstall the Thymio Suite.

The instructs are given for a `Ubuntu` system.
If you use another distribution, the steps to follow might be
slightly different. Please refer to the documentation of your distribution concerning **udev rules**.


‚ö†Ô∏è This step needs to be executed before you launch Thymio Suite.

‚ö†Ô∏è You will need root access - if you don't own the computer, ask your network administrator.

Using `nano` or `vi`, edit `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-mobsya.rules`.
For example

`sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mobsya.rules`

Add the following line into the file:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0617", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000a", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0617", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000c", MODE="0666"
```

Save the file (`Ctrl+x` if you use `nano`), then execute

```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```
