Thymio JS API
=============

Getting Started
---------------

The API is available for Javascript and TypeScript on NPM

npm -i "@mobsya/thymio-api"

This will install the api and its dependency.

The projects rely on ES8. You may want to set up
Webpack And Babel to support older browsers.

However, this projet will only supports browsers and node.js versions
with a compliant WebAssembly support.

A demo projet is available on Github
https://github.com/Mobsya/thymio-js-api-demo

Stability guarantees
--------------------

Only exported public symbols are guaranted to be supported
in subsequent version on this API.
