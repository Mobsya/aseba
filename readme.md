# Thymio suite

Thymio suite is powered by Aseba, which was the origin of Thymio's software. 


## Thymio and Mobsya fork

[Thymio](https://www.thymio.org) is an educational robot which goal is to let children discover programming. [Mobsya](http://www.mobsya.org) is a non-profit association which goal is to create products and service to help children to discover digital technology and sciences. It is at the heart of Thymio's development and takes care of its production and distribution.

Up to April 2018, Mobsya was working as part of the Aseba community in the [Aseba repository](https://github.com/aseba-community/aseba) to develop Thymio software tools in an integrated manner. After this date, Mobsya decided to fork the Aseba repository and to keep developping Thymio software tools in [its own repository](https://github.com/Mobsya/aseba).
